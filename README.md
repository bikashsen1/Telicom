During the project "Identify the potential Churners from the Telecom Data," as a Trainee Data Scientist at TuringMinds, the candidate's tasks and contributions included:

- Collecting data from various sources to build a comprehensive dataset for analysis
- Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis
- Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the telecom industry and identify potential churners
- Applying machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to predict churn probability for each customer
- Evaluating the performance of the machine learning models using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Fine-tuning the machine learning models by adjusting hyperparameters and feature selection techniques to improve their predictive power
- Conducting feature engineering to create new variables that capture important patterns and trends in the data
- Collaborating with other team members to share insights and findings, and to brainstorm ideas for improving the project's outcomes
- Presenting the project's progress and findings to stakeholders, including senior management and clients
- Documenting the entire project, including the data collection process, data preprocessing steps, model development, and evaluation results
- Keeping up-to-date with the latest advancements in AI/ML and Python, and incorporating them into the project whenever applicable
- Assisting senior data scientists in their tasks, such as data visualization, model interpretation, and report generation
- Participating in regular team meetings and discussions to provide updates on the project's status and to seek guidance and feedback from team members
- Actively seeking opportunities to learn and grow by attending relevant workshops, webinars, and conferences related to AI/ML and data science
- Contributing to the overall success of the project by being proactive, diligent, and detail-oriented in all tasks assigned.

<The candidate may have also conducted exploratory data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the telecom data and identify patterns and trends that could be useful in predicting churn. Additionally, the candidate may have performed feature selection techniques, such as correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination, to identify the most important variables for predicting churn. Furthermore, the candidate may have implemented data visualization techniques to present the project's findings in a visually appealing and informative manner.>
